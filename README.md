Modern Computer Vision technology, based on AI and deep learning methods, has evolved dramatically in the past decade. Today it is used for applications like image classification, face recognition, identifying objects in images, video analysis and classification, and image processing in robots and autonomous vehicles. Many computer vision tasks require intelligent segmentation of an image, to understand what is in the image and enable easier analysis of each part. Todayâ€™s image segmentation techniques use models of deep learning for computer vision to understand, at a level unimaginable only a decade ago, exactly which real-world object is represented by each pixel of an image. Deep learning can learn patterns in visual inputs in order to predict object classes that make up an image. The main deep learning architecture used for image processing is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), or specific CNN frameworks like AlexNet, VGG, Inception, and ResNet. Models of deep learning for computer vision are typically trained and executed on specialized graphics processing units (GPUs) to reduce computation time. In this project, I completely changed the structure of encoder and decoder using ResNet architecture in order to enhance the accurecy of detection.

**What is special about this project:**
- [ ] first time using resnet both for encoding and decoding without upsampler
- [ ] easy implementation of residual network architecture with pytorch
